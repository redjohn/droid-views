Playground for Android view generation.

The idea is that it would create xml files based upon the class names. Through a rake task it would generate the xml files for each view and place them in the directory.

VERY VERY rough.  Still trying to get the DSL right, then will go back and cleanup the code itself.  

At the moment, run both the main.rb and views.rb to see the results printed to STDOUT.
